# Dir-Ections
A file handling tool made to be used with big projects.

# Why Dir-Ections
This is linux alternative for selecting all the files in the directory with the given extension and perform actions on it. Ubuntu's own nautilus browser doesn't support this feature of selecting all the files with certain extension (like .txt, .mp4, etc) and perform actions that could only affect these given types.

# who could use
Any wndows, linux or mac user who want to manage files and perform OS specific commands on certain file types only.

# How to use
1. clone the repo (just go on very samall in size :))
2. Get to the parent directory in which you have to perform actions. Dir-Ection handles every file in directories and subdirectories itself.
3. You can also give the path to the parent directory without going(pasting the python file) to that directory too, just provide the path to directory.
4. Just type in the command in your terminal or command prompt: It will automatically follow along with you.
```
python3 DirActions.py
```
